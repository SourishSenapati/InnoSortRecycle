## KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening Hook

> "Ask any battery recycler: 'Can you process sodium-ion batteries?' They'll say 'Give us 2-3 years to retool.' RADORDENA? We can classify them **today** using zero-shot learning. That's the difference between automation and **artificial intelligence**."

### Mid-Pitch Power Statement

> "We address **5 market gaps** that competitors cannot fill. We generate **5 revenue streams** they ignore. And we're **EU-compliant 3 years early**, locking them out of 40% of the global market."

###Final Close

> "RADORDENA isn't just a startup. We're building the **operating system** for circular battery economies. And by the time competitors understand what we've built, we'll have an insurmountable data moat."

## ANTICIPATED JUDGE QUESTIONS

**Q: "Can bacteria really handle lithium-ion leaching?"**  
A: Yes. _Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans_ has been used in copper bioleaching for 40+ years. We've adapted it for battery chemistries. Our digital twin has run 10,000 scenarios proving 92%+ recovery.

**Q: "Won't competitors just copy your AI?"**  
A: They can't. Our training data (10,000+ images, 3 years of bacterial metrics) is proprietary. Even if they tried, they're 3 years behind, and our data advantage **compounds** over time.

**Q: "How do you make money from carbon credits?"**  
A: Voluntary carbon markets pay ₹500-1,500/ton CO2 avoided. We save 2.5 tons per ton of waste (vs. pyrometallurgy). At 500 tons/year, that's ₹10.6 Lakh additional revenue. **No competitor monetizes this.**

**Q: "What if EU regulations change?"**  
A: They can only get stricter (trend toward 95% recovery, full traceability). We already exceed current targets. Competitors are **behind** even today's requirements.

**Q: "Why would BMW choose you over Attero (market leader)?"**  
A: Three reasons: (1) We're EU-compliant, Attero isn't (2) We provide Digital Passports, they don't (3) Our 92% recovery means 15% more recycled content for their new batteries. **Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable.**

### If Sustainability Challenged

- **Evidence:** LCA based on peer-reviewed standards
- **Comparison:** Emissions vs. published industry benchmarks
- **Conservative:** 60% reduction is lower-bound (furnaces at 1400°C)
