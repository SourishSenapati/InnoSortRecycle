# RADORDENA Digital Twin Platform

**RADORDENA: Turning Urban Waste into Strategic Energy Assets**

> _AI & Biotechnology Integrated Recycling_

## Overview

This platform is the digital nerve center for **RADORDENA**, a hybrid, closed-loop recycling system designed for the Indian market. It addresses the 128 GWh battery waste surge by replacing high-energy smelting with a precision **Sort-Bioleach-Recover** pipeline.

## Modules (The Solution)

1.  **Intelligent Sorting (The "Eyes")**:
    - Simulates Hyperspectral Imaging (400-1000 nm) to identify NMC vs LFP chemistries with **95% accuracy**.
    - Includes safety protocols for NaCl discharge and N2 shredding.

2.  **Bioleaching (The "Core")**:
    - Simulates _Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans_ microbial factories operating at **30°C** (Ambient).
    - Models >90% recovery of Critical Minerals utilizing regenerative $Fe^{3+}$ oxidation.

3.  **Electro-Recovery (The "Harvest")**:
    - Simulates sequential electro-selective extraction of high-purity salts ($Li_2CO_3$).
    - Models circular integration (Water recycle >90%).

4.  **Financial Intelligence**:
    - Calculates Unit Economics: **$5-7/kWh** cost (30% lower than Pyro).
    - Models Profit Margin >60% and ROI of **2-3 Years**.

## Installation

1.  Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the application using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Scientific Basis

Built on peer-reviewed methodologies for:

- **Bioleaching**: _Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans_ mediated reduction of Fe3+.
- **Stoichiometry**: $Li_2Ni_{1/3}Mn_{1/3}Co_{1/3}O_2 + 6H^+ \to ...$
- **Economics**: Case study data for 500 TPA modular plant scaling.
