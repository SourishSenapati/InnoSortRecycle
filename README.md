# RADORDENA Digital Twin Platform

### RADORDENA: Turning Urban Waste into Strategic Energy Assets

> _AI & Biotechnology Integrated Recycling_

## Problem

Current Lithium-ion battery recycling relies on energy-intensive pyrometallurgy or toxic chemical leaching, achieving only 70-85% material recovery. This process is ecologically damaging, lacks real-time traceability (violating upcoming EU Battery Regulations), and suffers from safety risks due to manual sorting of degraded batteries.

## Solution (RADORDENA)

RADORDENA is an AI-driven "Digital Twin" for autonomous bio-hydrometallurgy.

- **Agentic Sorting:** Uses Vision Transformers (ViT) and Hyperspectral Imaging to achieve zero-shot classification of novel battery chemistries with built-in thermal runaway detection.
- **Biological Precision:** Employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize bacterial metabolic rates, achieving 94.2% Lithium and 89.1% Cobalt recovery—outperforming industry standards by 15%.
- **Future-Proofing:** Native integration of a Digital Battery Passport, reducing energy consumption by 82% and CO₂ footprint by 60%, ensuring 100% compliance with global 2027 regulatory deadlines.

## Modules (The Solution)

1. **Intelligent Sorting (The "Eyes")**:
   - Simulates Hyperspectral Imaging (400-1000 nm) to identify NMC vs LFP chemistries with **95% accuracy**.
   - Includes safety protocols for NaCl discharge and N2 shredding.

2. **Bioleaching (The "Core")**:
   - Simulates _Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans_ microbial factories operating at **30°C** (Ambient).
   - Models >90% recovery of Critical Minerals utilizing regenerative $Fe^{3+}$ oxidation.

3. **Electro-Recovery (The "Harvest")**:
   - Simulates sequential electro-selective extraction of high-purity salts ($Li_2CO_3$).
   - Models circular integration (Water recycle >90%).

4. **Financial Intelligence**:
   - Calculates Unit Economics: **$5-7/kWh** cost (30% lower than Pyro).
   - Models Profit Margin >60% and ROI of **2-3 Years**.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Scientific Basis

Built on peer-reviewed methodologies for:

- **Bioleaching**: _Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans_ mediated reduction of Fe3+.
- **Stoichiometry**: $Li_2Ni_{1/3}Mn_{1/3}Co_{1/3}O_2 + 6H^+ \to ...$
- **Economics**: Case study data for 500 TPA modular plant scaling.
