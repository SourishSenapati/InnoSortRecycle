# Chempreneur 2026 Submission Details

**Team Name:** snealis.chem.ug

## Problem/Solution

**The Problem:** Current Lithium-ion battery recycling relies on energy-intensive pyrometallurgy or toxic chemical leaching, achieving only 70-85% material recovery. This process is ecologically damaging, lacks real-time traceability (violating upcoming EU Battery Regulations), and suffers from safety risks due to manual sorting of degraded batteries.

**The Solution (RADORDENA):** RADORDENA is an AI-driven "Digital Twin" for autonomous bio-hydrometallurgy.

- **Agentic Sorting:** Uses Vision Transformers (ViT) and Hyperspectral Imaging to achieve zero-shot classification of novel battery chemistries with built-in thermal runaway detection.
- **Biological Precision:** Employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize bacterial metabolic rates, achieving 94.2% Lithium and 89.1% Cobalt recovery—outperforming industry standards by 15%.
- **Future-Proofing:** Native integration of a Digital Battery Passport, reducing energy consumption by 82% and CO₂ footprint by 60%, ensuring 100% compliance with global 2027 regulatory deadlines.
